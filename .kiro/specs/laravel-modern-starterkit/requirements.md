# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Laravel starter kit that provides developers with a modern, production-ready foundation for building web applications. The starter kit will integrate the latest versions of Laravel with Jetstream, Inertia.js, Vue 3, Sanctum authentication, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI components to deliver a cohesive development experience with authentication, UI components, and API capabilities out of the box.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Laravel starter kit with the latest framework versions, so that I can quickly bootstrap modern web applications without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the starter kit is configured THEN the system SHALL include Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
2. WHEN Jetstream is installed THEN the system SHALL use Laravel Fortify as the authentication backend
3. WHEN authentication is implemented THEN the system SHALL support both session-based and token-based authentication through Fortify and Sanctum integration
4. WHEN user management is active THEN the system SHALL include password reset, email verification, and two-factor authentication via Fortify
5. WHEN authentication features are configured THEN the system SHALL provide customizable authentication views through Jetstream's Inertia integration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern UI framework with pre-built components and custom theming, so that I can create attractive interfaces quickly with brand-specific styling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the starter kit is configured THEN the system SHALL include the latest version of Tailwind CSS
2. WHEN UI components are needed THEN the system SHALL provide Daisy UI component library
3. WHEN theming is required THEN the system SHALL support custom Daisy UI themes beyond the built-in themes
4. WHEN custom themes are implemented THEN the system SHALL allow theme switching and customization
5. WHEN the user interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL place the theme switcher beside the profile dropdown in the navigation
6. WHEN the frontend is built THEN the system SHALL have responsive design capabilities
7. WHEN styling is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent design patterns across components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless frontend-backend integration with type safety, so that I can build single-page applications with server-side rendering capabilities and robust development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use Inertia.js for seamless page transitions
2. WHEN data is exchanged THEN the system SHALL handle frontend-backend communication without API endpoints for page rendering
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain SPA-like experience with server-side routing
4. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL support both client-side and server-side data hydration
5. WHEN frontend code is written THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
6. WHEN Vue components are created THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript with proper type definitions for Inertia props and Laravel data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured project with modern development tools, so that I can maintain code quality and have an efficient development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include proper directory structure following Laravel conventions
2. WHEN development starts THEN the system SHALL use the latest version of Vite for fast asset compilation and development server
3. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL include linting and formatting configurations for TypeScript and Vue
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL support hot module replacement through Vite for rapid development
5. WHEN assets are built THEN the system SHALL use Vite for optimized production builds with code splitting and tree shaking
6. WHEN deployment is needed THEN the system SHALL include production-ready build configurations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example implementations and documentation, so that I can understand how to use the starter kit effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
